Synopsis of YAML Basic Elements
-------------------------------
The synopsis of YAML basic elements is given here: Comments in YAML begins with the (#) character. Comments must be separated from other tokens by whitespaces.
YAML does not support multi line comments.

List members are denoted by a leading hyphen (-).

List members are enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas.

Associative arrays are represented using colon ( : ) in the format of key value pair. They are enclosed in curly braces {}.

Multiple documents with single streams are separated with 3 hyphens (---).

Repeated nodes in each file are initially denoted by an ampersand (&) and by an asterisk (*) mark later.

YAML always requires colons and commas used as list separators followed by space with scalar values.

Nodes should be labelled with an exclamation mark (!) or double exclamation mark (!!), followed by string which can be expanded into an URI or URL.
